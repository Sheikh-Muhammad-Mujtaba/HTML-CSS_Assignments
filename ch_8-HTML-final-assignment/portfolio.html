          <strong>Why it's special:</strong> Robby incorporates an interactive
          experience into his portfolio. <br />
          <strong>What it's about:</strong> If you associate portfolios with a
          dry list of facts, this portfolio might surprise you. Robby found a
          novel way of displaying what was otherwise dry information he laid out
          his portfolio site as a videogame that the visitor can actually play.
          This incredibly fun interactive design portfolio will make you scroll

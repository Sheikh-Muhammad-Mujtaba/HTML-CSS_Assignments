    <h1>GIAIC</h1>
    <h2>Governor's Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing</h2>
    <p>
        Governor's Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (GIAIC) is
        a privately funded not-for-profit educational initiative started by
        Governor of Sindh, and Zia Khan to help promote education, research and
        business opportunities in emerging tech fields like
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cloud Native Computing</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
        <li>Blockchain</li>
        <li>Internet Of Things</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cloud Native computing:</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> program prepares the students
        to program in open source technologies like,
        <strong>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React
            Native</strong>
        while introducing the students to development of Microservices and
        software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>

    <h3>Artificial Intelligence:</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the
        student through the foundation of the Al technology, via teaching
        programming in open source languages like
        <strong>Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</strong> and
        teaching deploying practical Al solutions and use cases, and ending with
        real-life examples of modern day Al in practice.
    </p>

    <h3>Blockchain:</h3>
    <p>
        The main emphasis of <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is to understand
        the blockchains like
        <strong>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric),</strong> and learn to program
        in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The
        program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps),
        frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of
        Blockchain-as-a- service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial
        Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
    </p>

    <h3>Internet of Things:</h3>

    <p>
        The <strong>Internet of things</strong> program introduces the students to open source
        development technologies like <strong>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper,
            Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes</strong> while making them efficient in
        developing Micro Services for loT Edge, loT Cloud, and voice computing for
        device control.
